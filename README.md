# Linear-Regression
A Project on Application of Concepts of Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn and Visualizations using Seaborn
The dataset contains features of a car ranging from it's make, hosrepower it geneares, the weight it has, the number of cylinders it has in it's engines and the miles per gallon
which is our independent variable here and is to be predicted with high accuracy.
Various plots have been plotted which help in understanding visually varipus parameters and their relationships with each other.
There may be some flaws associated with my code and I hope those who would come upon this will let me know of any corrections that are to be made.
